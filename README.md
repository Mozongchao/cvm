# Computer Vision: Models Learning and Inference (Algorithms)

Python implementation of the algorithms in the book Computer Vision: Models Learning and Inference by Prof. Simon J.D. Prince. The book is available [here](http://www.computervisionmodels.com) and the algorithms [here](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/external/s.prince/book/Algorithms.pdf).

The algorithms are organised according to the chapters in the book which present several topics relating to Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

## Chapter 4
This chapter is a summary of the methods used to fit probability models to data. The chapter covers three methods with each one having two examples: _maximum likelihood estimate_ (4.1, 4.4), _maximum a posteriori_ (4.2, 4.5), and the _Bayesian approach_ (4.3, 4.6). The first set of examples are for the Univariate Normal Distribution and the latter is for the Categorical Distribution.

## Cahpter 6
This chapter focuses on introducing the two main categories of computer vision models; those that model the probability of the world state given the data (discriminative) and those that model the probability of the data given the world state (generative). There is only one algorithm in this chapter which is the basic generative classifier which can be found in the chapter_6 folder.\
Additionally, as described in the book, the generative classifier is used in Skin detection and Background subtraction. I have used the classifier in this chapter to build a Skin Detector in a separate project available [here](https://github.com/jimiolaniyan/SkinDetector).
